The cooperative minesweeper!

Enjoy the fun of the classic game: minesweeper, with a twist! Only one of you can mark, only one of you can sweep.
You must work together to clear the field. If you fail, you will blame your partner for the inconcievably horrible
death you must have experienced, there will be complaining, upset and general uproarious good fun.

A note: this project is just getting off the ground, as such there's not much point in looking through it (for now).
